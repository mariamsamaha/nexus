# üåå Nexus: Parallel Image Processing - Edge Detection

## Project Overview

**Nexus** is a scalable parallel and distributed system engineered for **high-performance edge detection** in images. The core goal of this project is to explore and implement various parallelism and distribution strategies to achieve measurable **speedup**, robust **scalability**, and effective **fault tolerance** in image processing tasks.

## üéØ Key Features and Goals

* **High-Performance Edge Detection:** Implementing established algorithms (e.g., Canny, Sobel) with a focus on speed.
* **Parallel Computing:** Utilizing multi-core architectures to process image data concurrently.
* **Distributed Scalability:** Spreading the workload across multiple machines/nodes for handling large datasets.
* **Fault Tolerance:** Designing the system to continue operation even if individual nodes or processes fail.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Rigorous measurement and comparison of speedup across the different implementation phases.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Phases

The development of Nexus is structured into three progressive phases, each building upon the previous one to introduce increasingly complex and powerful computing paradigms:

### Phase 1: Shared-Memory Parallelism (Single-Node Optimization) ‚ö°

* **Focus:** Implementing **threads** and/or **processes** (e.g., using OpenMP, pthreads, or language-native features) to leverage multi-core CPUs.
* **Goal:** Demonstrate initial, significant speedup compared to a sequential implementation on a single machine.
* **Implementation:** Parallelization of core image filtering and gradient computation steps.

### Phase 2: Distributed Computing (Multi-Node Scaling) üåê

* **Focus:** Moving to a multi-node environment using a message-passing interface (e.g., **MPI** or similar RPC framework).
* **Goal:** Achieve horizontal scalability by partitioning image data and processing it across a cluster of machines.
* **Implementation:** Development of communication protocols for data distribution, synchronization, and result aggregation.

### Phase 3: Big Data Processing & Fault Tolerance üõ°Ô∏è

* **Focus:** Integrating a **big-data framework** (e.g., Apache Spark, Hadoop MapReduce) to manage large-scale data and inherent fault tolerance.
* **Goal:** Process massive datasets (e.g., video streams, large image archives) efficiently while ensuring the system can recover from node failures without losing data.
* **Implementation:** Adapt the edge detection logic to run as a distributed job within the chosen framework, utilizing its built-in mechanisms for resilience and scheduling.
